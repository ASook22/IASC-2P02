## Shooting for the stars...and coming back in one piece!

Being a NASA Engineer, I have a forever evolving job. The great Space race between the United States of America and the USSR is a race that is never truly finished as it’s a milestone-driven marathon rather than a sprint. The Russians sent the first human to space in 1961, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, then we answered by sending the first humans to the moon with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. For the time being, we though that we had won the race and so the space race came to a halt. But the win came at a hefty price of 25.4 billion US dollars for the entirety of the Apollo 11 program alone. If we kept that budget for our programs, we will never be able to go any further than we have in space. Yes, this was a great achievement but we knew we had to come up with new ways to improve our space program in order to keep exploring without going bankrupt. 

  In 1981, we created the space shuttle program, a semi-reusable rocket with 2 Solid stage boosters, a giant fuel tank, and space shuttle attached. The program was a great success as we had a grand total of 73 launches to date with many different experiments and missions being done. That was until 9 years ago where there was a freak accident. Mission STS-51-L was 73 seconds into launch when Space shuttle Challenger exploded due to a mechanical failure which killed the crew on January 28th 1986. That lead us to grounding all missions until 1989. Being an engineer for the shuttles, I felt the overwhelming grief from knowing that I was partially responsible for the casualties onboard. So, I approached my fellow engineers and we knew that we needed to come up with a new, much safer, much cheaper alternative to our space exploration program. 
  
  After many failed prototypes, we came up with something which will drive down costs without sacrificing lives or the need to explore space. We came up with having a Self-landing first stage, in other words, the first stage from a rocket would separate from the second stage and continue to land on pad so it can be reused after a couple weeks of refurbishment. We named it the Eagle 9. This change saved us nearly $400 million per launch, as well as shortening the turnaround time between launches and is much safer with the added failsafe separation if there is any kind of emergency or failure. We came up with this idea using the information and technology we already had from the Apollo and Space shuttle programs. All we had to do was to use the propulsion technology we used for lunar landers and lots of predetermined coding together in order to code the rocket to land at a predetermined location and use the propulsion technology to realign and optimize our telemetry. 
  
  Today is the 4th of December 1995 in sunny southern Florida where we will be conducting our first unmanned test of the Eagle 9. Everything looked nominal with the countdown going down on the speaker from 10 to 1. The candle lit and Eagle 9 started to fly, so far so good. Now was time to see if our years of planning and testing would be successful. After 1 minute, stage separation was successful and the first stage came drifting down back to Earth. The small engines from the lunar lander puffing out compressed air to either side, aligning the 30-meter-tall cylinder right above the landing pad. The landing legs deploy and we knew this was the moment that would either make or break our program. After all the loud noise I close my eyes until dead silence to which I opened them and there it was, Eagle 9, standing on its own, in one piece. We can’t believe it, it actually worked. We celebrated our shared excitement as we, the same people who sent astronauts to the moon, have now made a successful, safe, and cheaper alternative to get Americans into space and explore further.
 
## Micro Essay

  In my speculative fiction story, the “Modern technology that was created after 2005” that was used in the 1995 setting was the self-guided first stage boosters used on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Starship Rockets which was first used in 2015. I though this would be an interesting way to incorporate new technology into 1995 because for even today, that technology is considered new and is still being improved on as seen in the Starship. The reason that this can engage media archeological thinking is by taking what we already had and improving on it (new adaptations and finding new uses). The Quote that I would like to support this Story to would be: “They are continuously remediated, resurfacing, finding new uses, contexts, adaptations.” (Parikka 2012). The story mentions how parts from previous missions were utilized in order to create these new rockets. Another possible quote that can support my story would be: “Partly this can be explained by the personal attachment that the current young consuming middle class who were the first generation to grow up midst of personal computers and gaming, handheld devices, Walkman’s and other 1970s and 1980s electronics.”(Parikka 2012). This generational theory can be applied to the story because the same middle-class population who were so intrigued by sending humans to the moon that they become engineers for NASA and in turn create a new fascination for the next generation. In conclusion, my story invites the reader to engage in critical and abstract thinking about media temporalities by making the reader see the connection between new and old media by finding new uses (or new media) through means of old and past technology (or old media)
